## Hey There, I'm Kylie!ðŸŒ± 

### About Me
I am a Front-End Web Developer that provides inclusivity and equitability within digital platforms and experiences.
I have experience in HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I'm currently expanding my experience with JavaScript using fetch and API. Looking for a full-time entry level Front-End Web Dev job following graduation. The projects I have done include skills not limited to using Figma for wireframing, developing using code in Visual Studio Code, responsiveness and accessibility.
